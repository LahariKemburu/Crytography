RC4 is a stream cipher and variable-length key algorithm. This algorithm encrypts one byte at a time (or larger units at a time). A key input is a pseudorandom bit generator that produces a stream 8-bit number that is unpredictable without knowledge of the input key, The output of the generator is called key-stream, and is combined one byte at a time with the plaintext stream cipher using X-OR operation.
